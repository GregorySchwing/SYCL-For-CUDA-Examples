Contributing
-------------

New examples or improvements to the existing ones are welcomed. 
Please, follow 
[LLVM coding standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html) when 
contributing code, since sometimes they will be contributed as tests to the
[DPCPP project](https://github.com/intel/llvm) project.

When writing your commit message, please make sure to follow 
[LLVM developer policies](https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#commit-messages) 
on the subject.
